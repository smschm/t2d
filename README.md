# t2d

## Or "turing2d". A noisemaker toy.

This is something I wrote long ago as an exercise in writing something simple in C without cutting any corners in the design phase as inspired by an initial reading of K&R---it is aggressively split into separate .c files and ad-hoc object-oriented-ish with structs to an unnecessary degree.

I'm having difficulty compiling it currently, as there is not an obvious SDL devel package for OSX, and it seems the API may have changed in the many years since this was written.  Those on other OSes may have better luck.

No documentation until I get around to compiling.

:sparkles: Comes with a bonus homerolled FFT algorithm! :sparkles:
